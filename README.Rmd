<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of xnnet0 is to build interpretable neural netwroks to solve a classification problem. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_git("bioinfo/xnnet0")
```

## Example

This is a basic example

##Building xnnet
```{r example}
library(xnnet0)
data("GSE37250") #load Tubercolosis dataset
data("annotation_libraries")
GSE37250_split = train_test_split(GSE37250$X, GSE37250$y)
xnnet = build_xnnet(X_train = GSE37250_split$X_train, y_train = GSE37250_split$y_train,
annotation_libraries = annotation_libraries)
```


##Plotting xnnet
```{r plot}
plot_xnnet(xnnet$Reactome_2016)
```
